## Description

This repository contains exercises and examples from the "Design Patterns in Python" course by Dmitri Nesteruk, focusing on implementing creational, structural, and behavioral patterns in Python.
I am also studying the books 'Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices' and 'Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#' by Robert C. Martin as part of this course. I will be writing down key notes from these books under each relevant section.
